Intro Script

(In silhouette)
"In a recent news story, it was reported that demand for security positions have been dwindling.",
"Eric Eiselhauser has just finished viewing this report in the nude, a Sunday tradition.",
"I can't believe this! Less security!",
"What if some weirdo showed up at the sports game! They could do whatever they pleased!",
"...",
"I know!",
"I'll protest by running around the field!",
"That way they'll understand the risks of no security.",
"Let's get dressed and get going."

- I only want to you to be safe!
- I respect your position!
